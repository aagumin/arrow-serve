# Arrow Serve

## Serve and inference ONNX ML models with Arrow flight.

A project utilizing Apache Arrow Flight focuses on improving network data transfer with high performance and low latency. Arrow Flight is an RPC framework optimized for Arrow's in-memory columnar format, enabling fast, efficient, and scalable data exchange.

Key Features Arrow flight for mlserve:
* High Performance: Minimizes serialization overhead for faster transfers compared to ODBC/JDBC.
* Streamlined Data Streaming: Supports batch-based streaming for high-throughput data pipelines.
* Cross-Language Support: Seamlessly integrates across platforms and programming languages.
